>Security and Access Control: GitHub provides features for managing access to repositories and protecting branches to ensure code integrity.


What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
branches allow developers to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments simultaneously without interfering with the main code.
Importance of Branches;
1. Multiple developers can work on different branches simultaneously, promoting collaborative development
2. Developers can work on new features in separate branches. Once the feature is complete and tested, it can be merged into the main branch.
3. bug fixes can be addressed in a separate branch and merged back into the main branch without waiting for ongoing feature development to complete.
4. Branches allow developers to maintain different versions of the codebase, which is useful for developing and maintaining multiple releases.
creating a branch:
>using the command git checkout -b new-branch-name
making changes:
>Edit files, add new files, or delete files as needed in the new branch then add, commit and push.
merging:
>click the "Merge pull request" button on GitHub

Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
This is a feature in GitHub that allowa developers to send notifications about changes made in the code.
How Pull Requests Facilitate Code Reviews and Collaboration:
1. Pull requests provide a platform for discussing the changes, understanding the rationale behind them, and addressing potential issues.
2. developers review the code changes, suggest improvements, and ensure the changes meet the project's coding standards.
3. Changes can be approved by multiple team members before being merged, ensuring consensus and quality control ceating approval workflow.
4. Automated tests and continuous integration processes can be triggered by pull requests to verify that the changes do not break the existing code.
Steps to Create and Review a Pull Request:
>create a branch
>work on the changes in the branch and commit them
>git push to reote repository
>open github repository and open the pull request tab
>click the new pull request button
>select the branch you want to merge into and the branch with your changes
>review the changes
>click pull request
Reviewing a Pull Request
1. Go to the "Pull requests" tab in the GitHub repository and select the pull request you want to review.
2. Review the changes in the "Files changed" tab and also add comments or suggestions directly in the code.
3. approve the pull request
4. merge the pull request


GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows directly in your repository.
How GitHub Actions Can Be Used to Automate Workflows
>Continuous Integration: Automatically build and test your code every time a commit is pushed to the repository.
>Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploy your code to production or staging environments after it passes the tests.
>Custom Workflows: Define custom workflows that run scripts, deploy applications, or perform other tasks.

example:
define workflow through the following:
1. Create a GitHub Repository:
2. In your repository, create a directory named .github/workflows. then Inside the .github/workflows directory, create a file named ci-cd.yml.
3. Add the following YAML configuration to ci-cd.yml where there are following requirements; 
>Name: The name of the workflow is "CI/CD Pipeline".
>Trigger: The workflow is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the main branch.
>Jobs: The workflow consists of two jobs, build and deploy.
Build Job
>Runs-on: Specifies the type of runner (in this case, ubuntu-latest).
